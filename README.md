# MLSMOTE
Multi label Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (MLSMOTE)

## Introduction
MLSMOTE is a technique used to handle data imbalance in multi-label classification problems. This implementation provides an updated version of the original MLSMOTE algorithm, with additional features and improvements.

## Changes
* **Updated to work correctly with pandas DataFrames as input**: Converted to numpy arrays before resampling and back to DataFrames after resampling.
* **Added `input_columns` and `label_columns` arguments**: Specify the input columns and labels for resampling.
